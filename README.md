# Unemployment_Analysis

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19.

The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19.
